# GenericML_blog_post

R code for the Medium blog post: Not Merely Averages: Using Machine Learning to Estimate Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (CATE, BLP, GATES,Â CLAN).

You can find the code for the beta R package GenericML by Max Welz, Andreas Alfons, Mert Demirer, and Victor Chernozhukov [here](https://github.com/mwelz/GenericML/).

The blog post very closely follows the example code published by GenericML package authors and all credit for implementing the generic ML approach in R goes to them!
